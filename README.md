The project consists of an initial part in which the inclusion of qualitative variables is evaluated through the creation of dummies variables.

Then some simple multivariate models with qualitative and quantitative variables together are analyzed, the possible collinearity between variables is analyzed, and the impact of including interaction variables and polynomial variables (degree >1) is evaluated.

Finally, an attempt is made to indicate an optimal model based on some indirect estimates of model error such as AIC , BIC and Cp, implementing the methods of forward stepwise selection and best subset selection.

Notes:

- I did not export a pdf as I noticed that some characters used and graphs were not being filled in.
- For the graphs and estimation of some indices I used libraries that are loaded at the beginning of the file, if by any chance you have problems in the compilation write me and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
